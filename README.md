# FrameExtractor-ObjectDetection

This project is a simple Python script that allows you to perform object detection on a specific frame of a video using OpenCV and a pre-trained object detection model. It's a useful tool for quickly analyzing the content of a video at a specific timestamp.

## Features

<strong>Object Detection</strong>: Detects objects in a specified frame of a video using a pre-trained model.
User-Friendly: You can specify the timestamp (hh:mm:ss) for the frame you want to analyze.
Frame Saving: The detected objects are annotated, and you can save the frame as an image for later reference.
